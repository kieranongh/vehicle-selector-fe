## About the tech stack

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I'm using NextJS's native API infrastructure instead of a separate Express or Koa app. This just seemed simpler and is very similar to Express, probably uses it under the hood.

## Getting Started
> Using node v18.17.1

First install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
